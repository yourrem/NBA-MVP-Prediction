# NBA-MVP-Prediction
Final Project for PSTAT 131 at UCSB. 


This project analyzes NBA player statistics to predict the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for each season using R. The goal is to identify the key performance metrics and team factors that influence MVP selection.
The workflow includes:
- Data Collection & Cleaning: Aggregated multi-season player stats from publicly available sources and cleaned for consistency.
- Feature Engineering: Created advanced metrics such as player efficiency ratings, win shares, and team performance indicators to better capture player impact.
- Data Visualization: Explored trends and correlations between statistics and MVP winners to identify meaningful patterns.
- Modeling: Built regression and classification models to predict MVP outcomes, evaluated using accuracy metrics and feature importance analysis.
- Insights: Highlighted the statistics most strongly associated with MVP selection, providing a data-driven perspective on player performance and recognition in the NBA.
This project demonstrates the application of data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization techniques in R to sports analytics.
